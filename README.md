# NodeExample
Sample Android app with embedded Node.js. 
The application prints "Hello world!" message to logcat from Node.
Additionally, it outputs the same message through http. The http server uses non-standard port 8080.

This example is related to my [blogpost](https://www.sisik.eu/blog/embedding-node-into-android-app) about embedding Node.js into Android apps.
